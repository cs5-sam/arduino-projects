<h1>Arduino Projects</h1>

This repo contains projects built on Arduino Uno interfacing it with different Sensors.

<h3>BrightControl</h3>

This project interfaces Arduino with LDR Sensor with LED.
Brightness of LED increases with increase in LDR value.


<h3>Portable_DM</h3>

This project interfaces Arduino with UltraSonic Sensor and LCD.
Displays the distance on LCD.


<h3>Timer</h3>

This project interfaces Arduino with LCD, piezo.
Displays time on the LCD and activate piezo as it strikes the desired time.


<h3>Eagle</h3>

This project intefaces Arduino with LDR Sensor, piezo and Infrared Light.
When the intensity of Light decreases below certain point it activates piezo.


<h3>Smart Dustbin</h3>

This project interfaces Arduino with Servo motor, UltraSonic Sensor, piezo and LED.
When an object comes within certain distance the servo opens the Bin with a buzzer and indicates using GREEN LED.
when the object is out of reach it indicates using RED LED.
